=== svn era Changelog ===

; (trunk): v2.0.1
* Localization added for various languages.

; 2010-11-16: v2.0 by Daniel Werner
* Version 2.0 almost is a complete rewrite of the extension, just the idea remains the
  same. It's the attempt to get rid of several bugs caused by the fact that MediaWiki
  is using several Parser objects. Therefore in v2 each Parser has its own Variables
  store, so nothing will get mixed up anymore. Full compatibility is given, except perhaps
  in cases where bugs were used intentionally.

** New features and bugfixes:
*** Inclusion of special pages in the middle of the page won't reset all defined
    variables anymore.
*** Variables should now be compatible with all other extensions, except for those still
    using Parser::parse() recursively in any way (which should never be done!).
*** For MW 1.12 and later, '#var' default value no longer gets expanded when not needed.
*** Experimental new function '#var_final' which allows to insert the variables final
    (last) value after page processing is almost through.
*** Global configuration variable '$egVariablesDisabledFunctions' added.

** Internal changes:
*** Parser class member $mExtVariables now contains an instance of ExtVariables where
    only variables for that parser are getting stored. They won't be deleted by other
    Parser actions anymore (e.g. special page inclusion doesn't reset variables anymore)
*** ExtVariables class now has public functions which should be used by other extensions
    for getting and setting variables information.
*** Removed global '$wgExtVariables' variable.
*** 'Variables_Settings.php' file for configuration settings added.

** Others:
*** Put under 'ISC License' (public domain before).
*** In case you are using Extension:Loops, you should update it as well to remain compatibility.


; 2011-11-14: v1.3.1.1 (re-pack of 1.3.1 tagged version for svn)
* Although 1.4 is released already and 2.0 in the trunk, ensure one last version
  compatible with MW < 1.12 still is available
* Some comments cleaned, 'RELEASE-NOTES' and 'README' files added.


; 2011-11-13: v1.4 by Daniel Werner
* Cleanup for use with more current MW versions:
** 'ParserFirstCallInit' hook in use and no more global extension functions.
** State of the Art internationalization files added.
* Dropped support for MW before 1.12
* 'ExtVariables::VARIABLES' constant with version info added.
* Put into mediawiki.org svn, 'RELEASE-NOTES' and 'README' files added.
